On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage. In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first. Only the strongest robots survive!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game. Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory. Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order. Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck.

Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot&apos;s speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it&apos;s time to get uncivilized.

Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena&apos;s circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player&apos;s turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot&apos;s speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents &amp;&amp;#35;40;either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path&amp;&amp;#35;41;. if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &amp;ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:21:14"}},{"id":"191982","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ZXis1qGcu_fGRohZooSzJXPXRaM=/0x0/pic2845618.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/j3CXVL4xVFpJ1igsMHuax0uXkbE=/fit-in/200x150/pic2845618.png","players":"2 - 8","playing":"15","published":"2016","minage":"8","name":"Knit Wit","description":"Knit Wit is a word game along the lines of Scattergories, with players trying to think up unique answers to particular categories in order to score points, but instead of using fixed categories, players generate their own categories while playing the game.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;To set up, each player takes numbered spools and looped strings based on the number of players, along with an answer sheet.

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company&apos;s weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Phase 1: Schemin&apos; Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Phase 2: Stealin&apos; The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player&apos;s best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they&apos;ll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round &amp;&amp;#35;40;e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine&amp;&amp;#35;41;. You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; card when you&apos;re in a train car that holds one of these items &amp;mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you&apos;ll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he&apos;s collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Each player&apos;s character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or &amp;&amp;#35;40;if you&apos;re running on top of the train&amp;&amp;#35;41; anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent&apos;s deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he&apos;ll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:40:24"}},{"id":"155173","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Gu6qBMCodPoxpjdoRhixiKmijrM=/0x0/pic1961853.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/8J9ytznCOFOl0SBadvbbQGZq3uw=/fit-in/200x150/pic1961853.jpg","players":"1 - 4","playing":"45","published":"2014","minage":"13","name":"Subdivision","description":"Subdivision mimics the city-building feel of B&amp;eacute;zier Games&apos; Suburbia, but differs in scope as now each player has been allocated a specific area in which to create the best possible subdivision, filling it with residential, commercial, industrial, civic, and luxury zones, while balancing various improvements to the area, including roads, schools, parks, sidewalks, and lakes.

A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles.

The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&amp;rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon&apos;s destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy&apos;s reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site&apos;s energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player&apos;s supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player.

Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &amp;ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy&apos;s known history.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders&apos; uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &amp;quot;Shepherd&amp;quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;You are a Sheep.&amp;&amp;#35;10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&amp;&amp;#35;10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&amp;&amp;#35;10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&amp;&amp;#35;10;You know how to defeat Wolf &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Ewe&apos;s The Force...&amp;quot;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &amp;ndash; with possible traitor&amp;&amp;#35;40;s&amp;&amp;#35;41; in your midst &amp;ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. &amp;&amp;#35;40;If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.&amp;&amp;#35;41;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Space Sheep!, on each player&apos;s turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;     Activate a System and take the action associated with it &amp;&amp;#35;40;moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds&amp;&amp;#35;41;,&amp;&amp;#35;10;     Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&amp;&amp;#35;10;     Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack &amp;&amp;#35;40;and knock the Wolf token on its side&amp;&amp;#35;41;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can&apos;t, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;     If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player&apos;s cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&amp;&amp;#35;10;     If players have found a Defender, place the player&apos;s cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player&apos;s turn, Wolf attacks.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can&apos;t discard enough cards &amp;ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &amp;ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play &amp;&amp;#35;40;more Systems = more complexity&amp;&amp;#35;41;, the number of tactic cards in the deck &amp;&amp;#35;40;fewer cards = greater difficulty&amp;&amp;#35;41;, the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards &amp;&amp;#35;40;more directions = greater variability&amp;&amp;#35;41;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:11:29"}},{"id":"147299","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/IvLVr8koYhqpF-8LuA8IwoL71yk=/0x0/pic2644229.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/OESvXAKSINUj98ZZBlnEFSKhPrw=/fit-in/200x150/pic2644229.jpg","players":"2 - 4","playing":"45","published":"2013","minage":"12","name":"Pocket Imperium","description":"War has erupted across the Imperium!

The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers &amp;&amp;#35;40;knights, assassins, abbots&amp;&amp;#35;41; and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That&apos;s why it is so important to have one&apos;s family members in the right place at the right time &amp;ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one&apos;s goals.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing &amp;&amp;#35;40;active&amp;&amp;#35;41; family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down &amp;&amp;#35;40;inactive&amp;&amp;#35;41;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Travel to Florence where you&apos;ll spend scrolls &amp;&amp;#35;40;and possibly money&amp;&amp;#35;41; to claim a city council or nobility tile.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Introduce a new family member to the board.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Raise all lying family members on the board.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game ends when the &amp;quot;Power of the Medici&amp;quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles.

They also take three stall cards &amp;&amp;#35;40;which highlight one or more sections on the game board&amp;&amp;#35;41; and one coin of each of the six colors. Five colored customers start at particular locations on the game board, with the sixth customer placed to the side. On a turn, a player either:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Draws two cards &amp;&amp;#35;40;face-up or face-down stall cards or market barker cards&amp;&amp;#35;41;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Moves a customer to a stall of that customer&apos;s color.&amp;&amp;#35;10;    Plays a stall card; then builds a new stall, expands an existing stall, or moves a blocked-off stall.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The active player can choose to move any customer, and that customer will move to the closest stall &amp;&amp;#35;40;measured on orthogonal paths&amp;&amp;#35;41; of the same color. Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player&apos;s own stall. If the active player owns the visited stall, he receives one coin of the stall&apos;s color for each tile in that stall; if not, the active player receives a one coin commission while the owner receives the normal payout. This customer is then swapped with the customer off the board.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;When building a new stall, a player cannot place it in the same region as another stall of the same color. Regulations! Restaurants must be placed in an area designated for them, while all other stalls must go in the market area. When expanding an existing stall, the player must pay one coin of the same color for each tile in the enlarged stall. By expanding, you can earn more coins when customers visit, create longer paths to opponents&apos; stalls, reserve area in which to expand further, and &amp;&amp;#35;40;most importantly&amp;&amp;#35;41; earn victory points. You score VPs each time you expand, and if your stall is the largest &amp;&amp;#35;40;or tied for the largest&amp;&amp;#35;41; of that color, you&apos;ll take one or two medals that provide a VP bonus.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Once the expansions run low in one or two colors, players can only build or expand.

As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game.

The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from &amp;&amp;#35;40;each with a special ability of their own&amp;&amp;#35;41;, many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value.

More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age.

All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &amp;quot;Steam&amp;quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&amp;ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &amp;ndash; like on earth &amp;ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &amp;ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:10:27"}},{"id":"38402","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/NArA8WUj6wtMykOxE2u4WB5NfFA=/0x0/pic1114287.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Q9kbfMr6WcFKHDaHCJAGailnzzY=/fit-in/200x150/pic1114287.jpg","players":"3 - 7","playing":"45","published":"2008","minage":"14","name":"Sidibaba","description":"In Sidibaba, players take on the role of Sidibaba and his friends who are searching for hidden treasure in a cave.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&amp;&amp;#35;10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &amp;quot;good old days,&amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player&apos;s ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &amp;quot;holds&amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &amp;quot;captain,&amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and which to the &amp;quot;night.&amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; - and one on the right &amp;&amp;#35;40;&amp;quot;night&amp;quot;&amp;&amp;#35;41;. The symbols indicate either ship movement &amp;&amp;#35;40;forward or backward&amp;&amp;#35;41; or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain&apos;s. When it is a player&apos;s turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &amp;quot;gunpowder&amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:42:33"}},{"id":"31730","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/5AsB8bKYMjmqMOtRse58ME7EZlM=/0x0/pic1566274.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/MxgEN3Yw4eK0sTxUyXjEDwpcaUg=/fit-in/200x150/pic1566274.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"60","published":"2007","minage":"12","name":"Chicago Express","description":"John Bohrer&apos;s Chicago Express is an innovative new boardgame with no luck factor.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous &amp;&amp;#35;40;so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west&amp;&amp;#35;41;. There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall &amp;&amp;#35;40;i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell&amp;&amp;#35;41;; the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &amp;quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&amp;quot;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2018-01-03 17:56:28"}},{"id":"2653","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/FiTVbnX8ZOWsdgBe87x4Lz3wFsk=/0x0/pic1300182.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/rNnnvjF1JSa3JUXJ-wU5Et0Qzho=/fit-in/200x150/pic1300182.png","players":"2 - 4","playing":"60","published":"1982","minage":"8","name":"Survive: Escape from Atlantis!","description":"Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean &amp;&amp;#35;40;as the tiles are removed from the board&amp;&amp;#35;41;.

Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster&apos;s counter-attack.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon&apos;s entrance.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Reimplemented by:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;    The Classic Dungeon&amp;&amp;#35;10;    The New Dungeon&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2017-12-13 16:14:38"}},{"id":"5","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Bz4tTHNpq6gUKFkJs0fJdVIGR1s=/0x0/pic3299296.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/ZODhu5g13HRQEcOgMP8oiRooQQc=/fit-in/200x150/pic3299296.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"90","published":"1964","minage":"12","name":"Acquire","description":"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player&apos;s hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2018-01-03 17:55:11"}},{"id":"2425","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/5kYXGo6qinql4h6Mvrc6m1pwdek=/0x0/pic2439783.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/29m5onrSaip9B1b4T1bANJKpTeg=/fit-in/200x150/pic2439783.png","players":"2 - 2","playing":"30","published":"1931","minage":"8","name":"Battleship","description":"Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.

Then each player shoots at the other&apos;s grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &amp;quot;Hit!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Miss!&amp;quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left &amp;&amp;#35;40;IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots&amp;&amp;#35;41;.  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.
