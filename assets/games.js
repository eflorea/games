In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team&apos;s four words are &amp;quot;pig&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;candy&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tent&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;son&amp;quot;, then I might say &amp;quot;Sam-striped-pink&amp;quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1.

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you&amp;rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven&amp;rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they&amp;rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you&amp;rsquo;ve seen your friends&amp;rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Since nobody holds a &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It&apos;s often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols &amp;&amp;#35;40;gun, rum, parrot, etc.&amp;&amp;#35;41;, and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both. When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don&apos;t want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;This version of Cartagena includes the classic base game mixed with Cartagena 2. The Pirate&apos;s Nest and several new variants. The game includes eight double-sided game boards, and to play the base game you use only six of them. Use more boards for a longer game, or fewer boards &amp;&amp;#35;40;and possibly fewer pirates&amp;&amp;#35;41; for a shorter game. To replicate Cartagena 2, you can flip over three or more of the game boards to create a secondary path that&apos;s separate from the first one. Now when you place pirates in the sloop, you can use an action to move the sloop to the start of the second path &amp;mdash; and with two paths, you have a harder time making huge jumps from start to finish.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;quot;Morgan&amp;quot; is a variant in which players can now draw cards by moving an opponent&apos;s pirate ahead, drawing one or two cards when the pirate stops at the first space that contains one or two pirates; this variant and all others can be used in any version of the game. With the &amp;quot;Filibusters&amp;quot; variant, whenever someone plays one of the twelve cards with a dark background, everyone other than the active player must discard until they have at most seven cards in hand.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Finally, the &amp;quot;Black Magic Woman&amp;quot; variant introduces special powers to the six symbols on the card, and when you play a card, you can use it for pirate movement like normal or use the card&apos; power. You can play two parrots as if they were any other symbol, or use a lantern to look at the top four cards and keep one of your choice. With the gun, you steal a card of your choice from an opponent&apos;s hand, with them getting one free draw in return. The treasure chest symbol lets you pick up the treasure chest from the space where you stand, most likely drawing cards from the deck as a bonus, but possibly suffering a snakebite that will have you running back for rum to help you forget the pain!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:20:30"}},{"id":"218603","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/pIBp9VeaI9zAlHERlAVCoK78LqM=/0x0/pic3364832.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/wPVcWFqE4b4xNWYdvpQck96jsaU=/fit-in/200x150/pic3364832.jpg","players":"2 - 4","playing":"60","published":"2017","minage":"10","name":"Photosynthesis","description":"Description from the publisher:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The sun shines brightly on the canopy of the forest, and the trees use this wonderful energy to grow and develop their beautiful foliage.

You will need to deduce what you&amp;rsquo;re holding by studying the other worshipers.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Preserve your sanity and escape from the ritual alive!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Game Play Overview&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Arkham Ritual, you don&amp;rsquo;t see the card you are holding. Instead, you see the cards other players are holding. You must guess the card you are holding by looking at other players&amp;rsquo; cards and the cards that have already been played.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game is played over multiple rounds where each round consists of multiple turns. During each turn, one player draws the top card of the deck, looks at it, and passes it to another player. The player who receives the card has a choice either to a&amp;&amp;#35;41; discard the card he / she is holding face up and take the new card without looking at it, or b&amp;&amp;#35;41; pass the card to another player without looking at it. After a player takes a turn, another player takes his / her turn.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The round continues until one of the round end conditions is met, at which point all players reveal their cards. At this time, if you are holding a cursed &amp;&amp;#35;40;red&amp;&amp;#35;41; card, then the card corrupts your mind and you lose your sanity. If you are holding a sane &amp;&amp;#35;40;blue&amp;&amp;#35;41; artifact card but some other players are also holding the same artifact card &amp;&amp;#35;40;regardless of their color&amp;&amp;#35;41;, the artifacts create an unpleasant resonance, corrupts your mind, and you will lose your sanity. You successfully survive the ritual only if you are holding a unique sane &amp;&amp;#35;40;blue&amp;&amp;#35;41; card.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Players lose their sanity by discarding sanity markers. New rounds continue until one or more players have lost all their sanity markers. All players who still have sanity markers survive the ritual.

The next corner comes closer. Glancing back, one of the chariots is already far behind, and just ahead another chariot&apos;s speed is too high for the corner, sending the vehicle crashing into the wall and out of the race. Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it&apos;s time to get uncivilized. Steadily you balance the javelin in your hand, waiting for the other charioteer to come into view&amp;hellip;or should you just overtake him and throw caltrops in his path?&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Chariot Race, players participate as charioteers in a great race in ancient Rome. Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena&apos;s circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player&apos;s turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot&apos;s speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents &amp;&amp;#35;40;either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path&amp;&amp;#35;41;. if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &amp;ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:40:10"}},{"id":"194626","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/3tGsZH7ZvxEXyc0IYY_gWwERsS8=/0x0/pic2913980.png","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/mye328dX1b43W-fk14ARQY6t_KI=/fit-in/200x150/pic2913980.png","players":"3 - 6","playing":"2","published":"2016","minage":"6","name":"Happy Salmon","description":"Description from the publisher:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Happy Salmon is a simple, ultra-fast, very silly card game.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;There are no turns.

Combine a Mutt card with any other suit in the game to increase its value!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Players place their bids each round by picking a bid card from the center of the table. The 1, 2 and 3 bid cards are all double sided, with one side displaying a safer &amp;ldquo;At Least&amp;rdquo; bid, and the other side displaying the more difficult &amp;&amp;#35;40;but more lucrative&amp;&amp;#35;41; &amp;ldquo;Exactly&amp;rdquo; bid.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Pups is a fun and thoughtful game that is easy to learn for both gamers and non-games alike.

Players must then decide who will get which dice, but each player must take one and only one.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;It&apos;s a simple task: maximize the potential of your dice among all of the players. The problem is that you have only ten minutes, and there are more than twenty bombs on your ship. You don&apos;t have time to think through every option. You barely have time to yell at Grandma as she reaches for that red die you need. This game will self-destruct in ten minutes...&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:50:28"}},{"id":"183251","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Wf7ocgmPXopC2cgd48UZm4EEr8E=/0x0/pic2727088.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/IRtwFzTtsEYNtpPkJMpG3QJxvCQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic2727088.jpg","players":"2 - 4","playing":"40","published":"2015","minage":"8","name":"Karuba","description":"This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use.

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &amp;ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet&apos;s most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible.

Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they&apos;ll find. Players collect resources &amp;&amp;#35;40;worth points&amp;&amp;#35;41; three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game&apos;s end.

If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he&apos;ll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:32:27"}},{"id":"147949","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/r7HeuJg7g-g4gEIeIZv6x0gVL9E=/0x0/pic1809823.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/E1Aka3dgRRi0d_yg3LpZi4948iY=/fit-in/200x150/pic1809823.jpg","players":"3 - 10","playing":"10","published":"2014","minage":"8","name":"One Night Ultimate Werewolf","description":"No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability.

To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch&apos;s location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You&apos;re free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn&apos;t overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player&apos;s time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent&apos;s time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &amp;quot;button income&amp;quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;What&apos;s more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces.

Economic groups like the Hanseatic League, the Welser and Fugger families, and merchants from Northern Italy established trading posts and factories in all of the important cities throughout Europe. These businesses provided the population with goods of all kinds, such as fur from the north, cloth from Flanders, wine from the south, and spices from India. The most important commodity of all was salt. In the Middle Ages salt was highly prized it was used to preserve food.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;In Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe, you are a powerful merchant! Start your trading posts in three cities. Recruit new merchants and send them to distant cities to establish trading posts and expand your interests. The more trading posts you have, the more commodities are at your disposal which you can sell profitably in foreign cities. To ensure that your commodities arrive safely at their destination, you must open up trade routes and equip caravans. You win the game if you are the first to deliver all of your commodities to foreign cities.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Catan Histories: Merchants of Europe is a twist on the 2010 release Settlers of America: Trails to Rails from designer Klaus Teuber and publisher Mayfair Games.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the &apos;island&apos;, which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from &amp;&amp;#35;40;each with a special ability of their own&amp;&amp;#35;41;, many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value.

More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age.

Sidibaba and his friends win if they manage to get the treasure and get out of the cave before their oil lamps go out. The leader of the thieves wins if Sidibaba and his friends don&apos;t get out of the caves in time, or when he manages to catch Sidibaba and his friends when they don&apos;t have a spare oil lamp left.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&amp;&amp;#35;10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &amp;quot;colleagues&amp;quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &amp;quot;good old days,&amp;quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player&apos;s ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &amp;quot;holds&amp;quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &amp;quot;captain,&amp;quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; and which to the &amp;quot;night.&amp;quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; - and one on the right &amp;&amp;#35;40;&amp;quot;night&amp;quot;&amp;&amp;#35;41;. The symbols indicate either ship movement &amp;&amp;#35;40;forward or backward&amp;&amp;#35;41; or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain&apos;s. When it is a player&apos;s turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &amp;quot;combat&amp;quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &amp;quot;gunpowder&amp;quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:22:49"}},{"id":"31730","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/5AsB8bKYMjmqMOtRse58ME7EZlM=/0x0/pic1566274.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/MxgEN3Yw4eK0sTxUyXjEDwpcaUg=/fit-in/200x150/pic1566274.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"60","published":"2007","minage":"12","name":"Chicago Express","description":"John Bohrer&apos;s Chicago Express is an innovative new boardgame with no luck factor.

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &amp;quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&amp;quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp;amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp;amp; Builders, Princess &amp;amp; Dragon and The Tower.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else&apos;s, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player&apos;s tile may also extend your own path in a direction you&apos;d rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Theme:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &amp;quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&amp;quot;, and the game as a whole representing &amp;quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&amp;quot;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Gameplay:&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in &amp;&amp;#35;40;yet&amp;&amp;#35;41;, the edge of the board or colliding with another player&apos;s token.

Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Players have cards in hand. On a player&apos;s turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this.

And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &amp;ndash; from the rules to the game play &amp;ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements &amp;&amp;#35;40;ranging from cities to tiny villages&amp;&amp;#35;41; with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Building streets is very simple. One a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&amp;rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&amp;rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn &amp;&amp;#35;40;where he will also get another six gold to play with again&amp;&amp;#35;41;. Players aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&amp;rsquo;t save forever.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game ends when one player can&amp;rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any trade markers left.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&amp;rsquo;s every player&amp;rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &amp;ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:39:53"}},{"id":"6249","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/kw2inREfU-Jpbpbv9VV1hGa0LWU=/0x0/pic4893652.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/WfMn5n1jTcr_rdtAngb51PHA6XI=/fit-in/200x150/pic4893652.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"60","published":"2003","minage":"8","name":"Alhambra","description":"Granada, 1278.

To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly.

At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide &amp;&amp;#35;40;secretly&amp;&amp;#35;41; which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire &amp;&amp;#35;40;dice&amp;&amp;#35;41;. The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate&apos;s Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Each island &amp;&amp;#35;40;except Pirate&apos;s Cove and Treasure Island&amp;&amp;#35;41; offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards.

Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component.

Buried treasure is converted to Fame &amp;&amp;#35;40;which is the ultimate goal of the game&amp;&amp;#35;41;.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates &amp;&amp;#35;40;which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman&amp;&amp;#35;41; is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &amp;quot;tall tales&amp;quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &amp;quot;pirate&amp;quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate&apos;s Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:23:07"}},{"id":"2842","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/VtGFsfVxbjmCV-_u_QNlSbSp2p4=/0x0/pic158561.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/WDzCJA0YLJXSQPvRzoNK2zdjO0s=/fit-in/200x150/pic158561.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"30","published":"2001","minage":"13","name":"TransAmerica","description":"TransAmerica is a simple railway game.

A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey. Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. &amp;&amp;#35;40;For instance, &amp;quot;how many fat monks do you have?&amp;quot;.&amp;&amp;#35;41; Players may either take a &amp;quot;vow of silence&amp;quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question.  &amp;quot;Mass&amp;quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue you don&apos;t automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;","status":{"own":1,"prevowned":0,"fortrade":0,"want":0,"wanttoplay":0,"wanttobuy":0,"wishlist":0,"preordered":0,"lastmodified":"2020-04-27 16:42:00"}},{"id":"2956","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/OcFfETuf8Lw0uTXD73Sq7Sb8SXk=/0x0/pic431806.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/BpVHRD4y4mgoJqHBVsLBY_wssAQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic431806.jpg","players":"2 - 6","playing":"45","published":"1990","minage":"18","name":"Dirty Minds: The Game of Naughty Clues","description":"DIRTY MINDS  The Game of Naughty Clues... is also known as &amp;quot;The world&apos;s cleanest dirty game.&amp;quot; The dirtier a mind you have, the worse you will be at playing DIRTY MINDS because all of the answers are clean!&amp;&amp;#35;10;&amp;&amp;#35;10;A player draws a card, and reads one of the facts about the word &amp;&amp;#35;40;they may choose&amp;&amp;#35;41;.
